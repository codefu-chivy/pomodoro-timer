# Pomodoro Timer

This front end application was developed as part of freeCodeCamp's front end project curriculum. It is based on the Pomodoro Technique where work sessions are split into 25 minute intervals followed by a 5 minute break. 
In this application there are 2 timers defaulted to 25 and 5 minutes, respectively, however, you may choose to lengthen or shorten both. Also features a progress bar.
